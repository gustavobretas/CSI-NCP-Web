# Listing the Resources Defined in a Package or Module

# Scenario
# You are implementing a program at work and you need to use a package 
# that you have never interacted with before. You find that you need to 
# write a script using the directory method to list all resources that 
# are available in that package.

# Aim
# Use a function which will take a package or module name and print out the 
# names of all the resources defined in the package or module using the directory method.

# Steps for Completion
# Define a function called resources_scanner that takes an argument package.
# Using the dir method create a variable to list all the resources that are available in that package.
# Inside the function, use a for statement to print and list each of the packageâ€™s resources.
# Run your script using the python3 main.py command in the terminal or by importing 
# and calling your method in the interactive python shell. The output should be as shown in 

# Snippet 8.37:
