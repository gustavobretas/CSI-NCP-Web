# Aim
# Work with the Python interpreter.

# Steps for Completion:
# At the command prompt, enter the command shown in Snippet 1.1. to 
# run the popular "Hello World!" program.
# >>> print("Hello World!")
# Hello World!
# >>>
# Snippet 1.1

# Calling print logs the passed message to the standard output.

# Anything you type into the shell is echoed back. Type "Echo" in the 
# shell to check this as shown in Snippet 1.2:
# >>> "Echo"
# 'Echo'
# >>> 1234
# 1234
# >>>
# Snippet 1.2

# You can even do some calculations (note that the order of operations 
# is observed). Carry out a few mathematical operations in the terminal, 
# like those shown in Snippet 1.3:
# >>> 9 + 3
# 12
# >>> 4 * 5
# 20
# >>> -6 + 5 * 3
# 9
# >>>
# Snippet 1.3

# Finally, exit the shell by running the exit() command as shown in Snippet 1.4:
# >>> exit() 

# Write your code here
print("Hello World!")
#
"Echo"
#
1234
#
9 + 3
#
4 * 5
#
-6 + 5 * 3
#
exit()
