# Adding Data to a Dictionary

# Aim
# In this exercise, we will practice frozen sets.

# Steps for Completion
# Go to the main.py file.
# Create a frozen set as shown in Snippet 6.130:

# rainbowcolors = frozenset(['V', 'I', 'B', 'G', 'Y', 'O', 'R'])
# Snippet 6.130

# Attempt changing the colors of the rainbow as shown in Snippet 6.131:

# rainbowcolors.add("white")
# Snippet 6.131

# This will give an error saying that the object does not have the add attribute.

# Write your code here
rainbowcolors = frozenset(['V', 'I', 'B', 'G', 'Y', 'O', 'R'])
rainbowcolors.add("white")
