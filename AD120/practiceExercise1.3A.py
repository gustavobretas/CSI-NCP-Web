# Aim
# Check the types of different values.

# Steps for Completion
# Open the Python interactive shell and enter the code shown in Snippet 1.13 
# to view the type of the numeric value 7. Observe the output:
# >>> type(7)
# <class 'int'>
# >>>
# Snippet 1.13

# As you can see, it tells us that the type of 7 is int (short for integer).

# Now, enter the code shown in Snippet 1.14, and observe the output:
# >>> type(4+3)
# <class 'int'>
# >>>
# Snippet 1.14

# Enter the code in Snippet 1.15 in the prompt, and observe the output:
# >>> type("7")
# <class 'str'>
# >>>
# Snippet 1.15

# Enter type('7') as shown in Snippet 1.16 and observe the output:
# >>> type('7')
# <class 'str'>
# >>>
# Snippet 1.16

# The part in the output before int says class because everything in Python is an object.

# Write your code here
print(type(7))
print(type(4+3))
print(type("7"))
print(type('7'))
