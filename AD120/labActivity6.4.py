# Building a Set

# Scenario
# Imagine that you have some data in a list that contains a lot of duplicates 
# that you want to remove, but for simplicityâ€™s sake, you want to avoid writing 
# a for loop and building a new list.

# Aim
# The aim of this activity is to build a set out of a random set of items. 
# Write a function called list_to_set that takes a list and turns it into a set. 
# Do not use a for loop or while loop to do so.

# Steps for Completion
# Define the function list_to_set to take an argument of a list (the_list).
# Within the list_to_set function, use another function to convert the list into a set.
# Return the set.

# Snippet 6.90 shows an example of how the function list_to_set would work using the correct function:

# the_list = [2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 12, 10, 10]
# the_set = list_to_set(the_list)
# print(the_set)
 
# {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}
# Snippet 6.90

# Note: The example above is only showing the logic to what the correct 
# function used within list_to_set will do.

# Write your code here
def list_to_set(the_list):
    return set(the_list)

# Test your code with the following
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(list_to_set([2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 12, 10, 10]))
