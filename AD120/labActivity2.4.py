# Using Boolean Operators

# Scenario

# You have been given three code snippets that need to be completed in order to execute.

# Aim
# In each of the code snippets replace the ? character with the correct Boolean operator, 
# for instance <,>,==,not, or not in. Each code block should execute correctly.

# After you have executed a code snippet, run the corresponding task to ensure you have 
# passed before moving on to the next snippet.

# Steps for Completion
# Consider the following code in Snippet 2.82:
# num = 61
# if num % 2 ? 0:
#     print("Odd")
# Snippet 2.82

# Consider the following code in Snippet 2.83:
# days = 32
# if days ? 31:
#     print("Not a valid day of the month.")
# Snippet 2.83

# Consider the following code in Snippet 2.84:
# character = "c"
# if character ? ["a", "i"]:
#     print(f"The letter '{character}' does not also constitute a word.")
# Snippet 2.84

# Write your code here
num = 61
if num % 2 > 0:
    print("Odd")

days = 32
if days > 31:
    print("Not a valid day of the month.")

character = "c"
if character not in ["a", "i"]:
    print(f"The letter '{character}' does not also constitute a word.")
