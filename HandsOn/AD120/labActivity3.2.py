# Working with the if Statement

# Aim

# We have recently walked through a simple if statement block that results to a 
# value based on the input given. The script is shown again in Snippet 3.11:

# python3_year = 2008
# year = int(input('When was Python3 first released?'))
 
# if year == python3_year:
#     print('That is correct.')
# elif year > python3_year:
#     print('Incorrect, too late.')
# elif year < python3_year:
#     print('Incorrect, too early.')
# print('Have a great day!')
# Snippet 3.11

# Modify this block as follows:

# • The user prompt should be Return TRUE or FALSE: Python3 was released in 2008:.

# • If the user inputs TRUE, print out Correct.

# • If the user inputs FALSE, print out Incorrect.

# • Any other user input should result in Please answer TRUE or FALSE.

# Go to your main.py file and add your code to it. Then, run it in a terminal. 
# The output should look like Snippet 3.12:

# python3 main.py
# Return TRUE or FALSE: Python3 was released in 2008:
# TRUE
# Correct
# Have a great day!
# python3 main.py
# Return TRUE or FALSE: Python3 was released in 2008:
# FALSE
# Incorrect
# Have a great day!
# Snippet 3.12

# Write your code here
year = input('Return TRUE or FALSE: Python3 was released in 2008: ')

if year == 'TRUE':
	print('Correct')
elif year == 'FALSE':
	print('Incorrect')
else:
    print('Please answer TRUE or FALSE')
    
print('Have a great day!')
