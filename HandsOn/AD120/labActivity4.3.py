# Function Arguments

# Scenario

# Given a list, an array, or other data structure that includes a number of 
# different data types, you want to be able to filter out all of the integers 
# and give an output of the remaining bits of data.

# Aim
# Write a function that receives a number of arguments; using a continue statement, 
# skip integers and print out all other values.

# Steps for Completion
# Define a function named skip_integers, with a variable number of arguments.

# Use a for loop to iterate over the arguments.

# Use a check to see whether the value passed is of the integer type. If it is, 
# use the continue statement to ignore it.

# Print the arguments.

# The output should be as shown in 
# Snippet 4.30:
# 5.2
# value
# 6.0
# Snippet 4.30

# Write your code here
def skip_integers(*args):
    for argument in args:
        if type(argument) == int:
            continue
        print(argument)

# Test you code here
skip_integers(3, 5.2, "value", 6.0)
