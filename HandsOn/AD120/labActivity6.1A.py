# Creating a Dictionary

# Aim

# We will create a dictionary and verify its type.

# Steps for Completion
# Go to the main.py file.

# Use the dict function or curly bracket notation to create a dictionary 
# and assign it to a variable, location.

# Within a print function, use the built-in type function on location to see if 
# it is an instance of the dict class.

# A typical example of a dictionary is shown in 

# Snippet 6.5:
# location = dict(
#     state="CA",
#     city="Los Angeles"
# )
# Snippet 6.5

# In this example, state and city are keys, while CA and Los Angeles 
# are the respective values assigned to them.


# Write your code here
location = dict(
    state="CA",
    city="Los Angeles"
)

print(type(location))
