# Scenario
# You have been given an arithmetic expression 
# and need to turn it into a Python expression.

# Aim
# Rewrite the equation shown in Figure 2.4 as a Python 
# expression and get the result of the equation: 
# Pay special attention to the order of operations.

# Figure 2.4

# Prerequisites
# Python follows the mathematical rules that you're 
# accustomed to. A lot of what you'd expect to work 
# mathematically can be intuitively tried out in Python, 
# and will often work.

# Steps for Completion
# Find the answer to the formula referenced above and 
# print the result to the terminal.

# Write your code here
print((3*(9-2)+(24/(6/3))*3))
