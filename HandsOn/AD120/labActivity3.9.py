# Breaking out of Loops

# Scenario

# You have been asked to write a loop that outputs values in a database column 
# ranging between 10 and 100. Any number that is not divisible by 5, and any 
# value that is not an integer, should be ignored. When the value in the loop hits 95, 
# break the loop prematurely. One of your team members has advised the use of break, c
# ontinue, and pass statements.

# Steps for Completion

# 1 Define a for loop, using the range function to create the lower (10) and upper (100) limits.

# 2 Define a condition that checks for zero.

# 3 Define a condition that checks whether the number is divisible by 5.

# 4 Define a condition that checks the data type.

# 5 Define a condition that checks for 95, and breaks the loop.

# 6 Define a condition that uses the pass statement if the number doesn't meet any condition.

# 7 Print the number if it meets the condition.

# The output will be as shown in Snippet 3.65:
# 10
# 15
# 20
# 25
# 30
# 35
# ...
# ...
# 80
# 85
# 90
# Snippet 3.65

# Write your code here
for i in range(10, 100):
    if i == 95:
        break
    elif type(i) != int:
        continue
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print(i)
        pass
