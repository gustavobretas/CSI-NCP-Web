# Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
# >>> 
# In the output, you will see a line saying Type "help", "copyright", 
# "credits" or "license" for more information.

# Run help() to open the help utility.
# Type keywords in the prompt as shown in Snippet 1.42:
# help> keywords
# Snippet 1.42

# You should see the following list as shown in Snippet 1.43:

# Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.

# False               def                 if                  raise
# None                del                 import              return
# True                elif                in                  try
# and                 else                is                  while
# as                  except              lambda              with
# assert              finally             nonlocal            yield
# break               for                 not                 
# class               from                or                  
# continue            global              pass                

# help>                
# Snippet 1.43

# Quit the help utility by typing quit as shown in Snippet 1.44. 
# This should take you back to the interpreter prompt:
# help> quit
# Snippet 1.44

# You should not use any word from this list of keywords as an 
# identifier name. Note that you don't have to remember them all as the 
# Python interpreter will restrict you from using them.
