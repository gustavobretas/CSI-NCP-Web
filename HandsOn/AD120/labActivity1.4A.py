# Scenario
# You have been given some Python code that doesn't 
# work due to syntax errors and you need to fix the code by correcting poor indentations.

# Aim
# To fix the code snippet in the main.py file from the code 
# bundle to have the appropriate indentation in each block. 
# After you fix it, run the script in the terminal and verify
# that you get the output. Don't worry if you don't understand 
# what the code is doing; the goal is to get comfortable with 
# indentations. The incorrect code is also shown in Snippet 1.71 below:

# if 14 > 7: 
#     print("Greater than")
#    x = 2
#   print(x * 7)
# else:
#     print("Less than")
#    print(7)

# Hint: Indentation for statements in a block is dictated 
# by the first statement's indentation level.

# The output of the correct syntax should be as shown in Snippet 1.72:

# Greater than
# 14

# Write your code here
if 14 > 7:
    print("Greater than")
    x = 2
    print(x * 7)
else:
    print("Less than")
    print(7)
