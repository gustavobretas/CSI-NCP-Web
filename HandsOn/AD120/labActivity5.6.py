# Using Tuple Methods

# Scenario
# Given a Tuple, find out the number of times a string occurs.

# Aim
# Write a script that uses tuple methods to count the number of elements in a 
# tuple and the number of times a particular element appears in the tuple. Based on 
# these counts, the script will also print a message to the terminal.

# Steps for Completion
# Initialize a tuple, as shown in Snippet 5.37:

# cars = ('coupe', 'coupe', 'coupe', 'carbiolet', 'sedan')
# Snippet 5.37

# Use a tuple method to count the number of times the coupe element appears in the 
# tuple cars, and assign it to a variable, fav.

# Use a tuple method to calculate the length of the tuple cars, and assign it to a variable, amt.

# If the number of times the coupe element appears in the tuple cars is more than 45%, 
# print Too many coupes in the garage. to the terminal. If not, print You are all set 
# with cars. to the terminal.

# Write your code here

cars = ('coupe', 'coupe', 'coupe', 'carbiolet', 'sedan')
fav = cars.count('coupe')
amt = len(cars)
if fav / amt * 100 > 45:
    print("Too many coupes in the garage.")
else:
    print("You are all set with cars.")
