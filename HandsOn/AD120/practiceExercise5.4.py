# Creating a Tuple

# Aim

# In this exercise, we will create a tuple of our own. We will 
# create a vehicle tuple, add the elements listed as follows, and verify the object type.

# The elements are as follows:

# • Toyota

# • BMW

# • Benz

# Steps for Completion

# Create the tuple and populate the elements, shown in Snippet 5.20 below:
# vehicle = ('Toyota', 'BMW', 'Benz')
# Snippet 5.20

# Verify the object type as shown in 
# Snippet 5.21:
# print(type(vehicle))
# <class 'tuple'>
# Snippet 5.21

# Write your code here --> Run the code on Interpreter, line by line
