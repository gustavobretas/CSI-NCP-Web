					An Alligator is a crocodilian in the genus Alligator of the family Alligatoridae. The two extant species are
					the American alligator (A. mississippiensis) and the Chinese alligator (A. sinensis). Additionally, several
					extinct species of alligator are known from fossil remains. Alligators first appeared during the Oligocene
					epoch about 37 million years ago. The name "alligator" is probably an anglicized form of el lagarto, the
					Spanish term for "the lizard", which early Spanish explorers and settlers in Florida called the alligator.
					Later English spellings of the name included allagarta and alagarto. Source:

					Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans.
					Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats
					throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents
					of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies
					with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile
					claws, and short tails.. Source:

					The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, characterized by an
					upturning tail. The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's
					nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunterâ€“gatherers over
					15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs
					have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich
					diet that would be inadequate for other canids. Source:
