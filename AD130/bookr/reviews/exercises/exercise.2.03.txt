Exercise 2.03: Using the create() Method to Create an Entry

Here, you will create a record in the contributor table using the create() method in a single step:

First, import the Contributor class as before:
>>> from reviews.models import Contributor

Invoke the create() method to create an object in the database in a single step.
Ensure that you pass all the required parameters (first_names, last_names, and email):

>>> contributor = Contributor.objects.create(first_names="Rowel", last_names="Atienza", email="RowelAtienza@example.com")

Use DB Browser to verify that the contributor record has been created in the database.
If your DB Browser is not already open, open the database file db.sqlite3 as we just did in
the previous section. Click Browse Data and select the desired table – in this case, the
reviews_contributor table from the Table dropdown, as shown in the screenshot – and verify
the newly created database record:

In this exercise, we learned that using the create() method, we can create a record for a
model in a database in a single step.

Creating an Object with a Foreign Key
Similar to how we created a record in the Publisher and Contributor tables, let's now create
one for the Book table. If you recall, the Book model has a foreign key to Publisher that cannot
have a null value. So, a way to populate the publisher's foreign key is by providing the created
publisher object in the book's publisher field as shown in the following exercise.
