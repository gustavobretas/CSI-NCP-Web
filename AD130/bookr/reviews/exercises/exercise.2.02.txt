Exercise 2.02: Creating an Entry in the Bookr Database

In this exercise, you will create a new entry in the database by saving a model instance.
In other words, you will create an entry in a database table without explicitly running a SQL query:

1.First, import the Publisher class/model from reviews.models:

>>>from reviews.models import Publisher

2.Create an object or an instance of the Publisher class by passing all
the field values (name, website, and email) required by the Publisher model:

>>>publisher = Publisher(name='Packt Publishing', website='https://www.packtpub.com', email='info@packtpub.com')

3.Next, to write the object into the database, it is important to call the save() method,
because until this is called there will not be an entry created in the database:

>>>publisher.save()

Now you can see a new entry created in the database using DB Browser:

4.Use the object attributes to make any further changes to the object and save the changes to the database:

>>>publisher.email
'info@packtpub.com'
>>> publisher.email = 'customersupport@packtpub.com'
>>> publisher.save()

You can see the changes using DB Browser as follows:

In this exercise, you created an entry in the database by creating an instance of the model
object and used the save() method to write the model object into the database.

Note that by following the preceding method, the changes to the class instance are not saved
until the save() method is called. However, if we use the create() method, Django saves the
changes to the database in a single step. We'll use this method in the exercise that follows.
